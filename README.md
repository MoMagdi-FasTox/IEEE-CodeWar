## Objective

 - This plan is about programming solving problem competition for IEEE Al-Azhar members.
		
 - The plan target is to train members in this competition so they improve their skills in problem solving and improve their ability to join outer problem solving events.
 - The plan is based on two essential points:
			 -  First : Problem Solving skills.
			 - Second : Team-work*.

*Most of problem solving competitions are made in teams and you cannot join as a single competitor, So it's important to gain the skill of solving problems in a team , and also to build a good team.

## How it works

- We will be using [vjudge.net](https://vjudge.net/) to make our competitions.
- [vjudge.net](https://vjudge.net/) provides group system , so will be easily having a group for our member.

## Point System

For each competition their will be 3 sets of questions (Easy, Medium , Hard).
Each set consists of 3 problems , after passing a problem successfully member will get a score of points depends on the hardness of the problem.

## Schedule
Each competition will be 3 hours in length consists of 9 problems to solve.

Each month we will be holding 3 competitions 
- First and Second one are single online.
- Third is in teams offline.
## Winner titles
- The member with highest score in the month ( Total of single score and team score) will be awarded as **Warrior of the month**
- The member with highest score in the season ( Total of all months) will be awarded as **Warrior of the season**
